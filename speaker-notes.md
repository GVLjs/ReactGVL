### Tips for ReactGVL Speakers

---

* **Keep it simple**: Have a single, focused topic or idea that you can present in 15-20 minutes. The talk should be a kick-off point for more exploration and questions later not an in-depth tutorial.
* **Keep it legible**: If showing code or other text, use a high contrast theme and large font size.
* **Be prepared**: Make sure you have the proper HDMI input for the projector if you're using it. We recommend coming early to test your setup.
* **Speak up**: The acoustics in the room are challenging so be sure to speak clearly into the mic.
* **Use inclusive language**: Avoid saying “you guys” etc… Simple things like this go a long way in making everyone attending feel welcome.
* **Stay positive about tools**: Bashing other frameworks/tools can make people feel bad/unwelcome and doesn't accomplish anything good.
